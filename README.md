# Trial By Digital
Real-Time Courtroom Behavioral Intelligence

Problem & Solution Statement for Trial By Digital

Problem:
In high-stakes courtroom environments, every facial twitch, tonal shift, or emotional reaction can hold legal weight yet these behavioral cues are largely subjective, go undocumented, and vanish as quickly as they appear. Legal professionals, jurors, journalists, and even the public have no reliable system to quantify or retain these crucial micro-moments. This creates a justice blind spot, one that AI is uniquely suited to fill, but has yet to be meaningfully applied.

Solution:
Trial By Digital is a pioneering AI-powered platform that captures, analyzes, and reports on real-time behavioral data in courtroom environments using multimodal AI. Leveraging facial emotion recognition, voice tone analysis, and speech transcription, the system generates instant, PDF-ready behavioral intelligence reports from video and audio of court proceedings.

Imagine uploading a still imagine from a trial and immediately receiving a breakdown of the subject’s emotional state. Or feeding a .wav file of courtroom dialogue and instantly getting a transcript and an inferred emotional profile of the speaker. Now imagine this system scaled to operate live, streaming analysis to legal teams, journalists, or the public. That’s Trial By Digital.

Core Features:
	•	TrialVoice: Transcribes speech via AI and performs tone/emotion analysis on vocal delivery, enabling behavioral insight even when visuals aren’t available.
  	•	TrialVoice:  Integrates Granite 3.3 Instruct for summarizing transcripts and inferring tone and intent. Its fill-in-the-middle and long-context reasoning powers instant behavioral reports, designed for courtroom transparency and precision.
  	•	Behavior Summary Engine: Uses reasoning models (designed to be IBM Granite-ready) to generate clear, contextual behavioral reports.
	•	PDF Court Report Generator: Instantly packages this intelligence into downloadable, presentable reports for lawyers, media, and oversight organizations.

Target Users:
	•	Trial attorneys (live behavioral feedback for strategy)
	•	Journalists (enhanced coverage + visual data)
	•	Civil rights observers (accountability tools)
	•	Investigators & analysts (pattern recognition across trials)
	•	Artists & creators (translating courtroom emotion into interactive exhibits)

AI Usage:
Trial By Digital is a Granite-compatible multimodal AI system. The architecture is built to directly plug into IBM’s Granite Speech 8B and Instruct models for next-gen accuracy, enterprise compliance, and scalability. This platform uses AI not just to interpret data, but to document and preserve emotional reality in an evidentiary form.

Why It’s Unique:
No one else is doing this. Trial By Digital is the first system to treat courtroom behavior as structured data, using AI to reveal hidden emotional narratives. It redefines transparency and gives the legal system a new form of accountability, insight, and storytelling. It’s also a cultural tool, bridging AI, law, and digital art and it’s built to scale.
